# primer-repo

First Git + GitHub repository created from the command line on Windows.

## What this repo includes
- A basic `README.md`
- An initial commit and push to GitHub using Git CLI

## Why it exists
I’m setting up my Git workflow for upcoming cybersecurity / SOC portfolio projects.

## Next steps
- Add a `.gitignore`
- Add a small practice file (`notes.md`)
- Keep building more repos with real projects
